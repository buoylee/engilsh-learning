**谓语往往比主语更重要, 为了强调谓语而使用.**

包括`NAOSHI`.

## 部分倒装

否定词 + '一般疑问句'

```
He seldom gose out for dinner.
==> seldom dose he go out for dinner.
```



- `N` 否定 不能再出现 `not`

  - seldom, never, not, nor, neither, nothing, nowhere, no longer.
  - seldom, little, few, rarely, scarcely, hardly.
  - 否定词组, by not means, in no case, in no way, at no time, in no sense, on no account, under nocircumstances, on no account. == never.
  
- `O` only `只有 only + 状语才需要倒装`. 从句照抄, 主句变一般疑问句.

  only yesterday did he get news.

  

- `S` so, such. `so + a./ad.`, `such + n.`

  ```
I was so interested in this video game that I didn't notice my father was behind me. 
  ==> so interested was I in this video game...
  ```
  
   **so do I, so I do**
  
  前者表`也`, 后者`确实`.
  
  **当句中出现多个动词(, 意思)时**, 不能用 上边的方式, 要用`so it is with sb.`
  
  
  
- `I` if. 看if虚拟语气.



## 全部倒装

### 所有地点

here,  there, now, then, up, down, in, out, away, off, back.. from behind the door 地点状语等.

### 2个时间

then, now

### 只能用一般现在, 一般过去时.

### 主语为代词时, 只需要地点,  时间提前.

here he waits. 



## AS 这不是倒装

### although + 主 + 系 + 表

- although + 主 + 系 + 表
- though...
- even though/if...
- while...



**改写方式: 只提前表语**

```
Although I was tired at that time, I was very happy.
==> Tired as(though)(只有as在这个位置的时候为"尽管", 句首是"因为") I was at that time, I was very happy.
```

**注意, 如果表语部分带有冠词, 前置时省略冠词.**



### though + 主 + 情态动词 + 动词

**改写方式: 只提前表语**

```
Though they might search, they could find nothing.
==> search though they might, they could find nothing.
```
