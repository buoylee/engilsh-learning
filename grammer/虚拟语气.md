 # 半虚拟

## 半虚拟改写

## 一般改写

I wound have phoned you ~~**if** I had been at home yesterday. But~~ (**, but**) I was outside.



### with/without/but for + 名词

what would you do ~~if you had~~(**with**) 1 million dollars now? 

**With** enough time, I would have gone to the cinema with you.

I would not have finished the work so easily, **without/but for** you help.



### otherwise/or

I didn't know his telephone number, ~~if I had known his number,~~ (**otherwise**) I would have phoned him.



### 虚拟倒装

#### 条件

- 必须是`非真实条件句`.
- if句中有`were, had, should`时.
- 如果if有否定句, 不用提前not.

```
if I were you, I would leave now.
==> were I you, I would leave now.
```



# 情态动词虚拟语气

表**本可以**, 都是对**过去的虚拟**

- could/might have done
- should/ought to have done, 相对could, 带有责备, 较强烈语气.
- needn't have done

**she could/might have come yeasterday 有2种意思, 1. 她昨天本来可以来; 2. 他昨天可能来了.**



# should 虚拟

1. 建议, 命令, 请求 + that + (should) do, 表真的想做. 

```
I suggest that he (should) leave now.
```

所有`建议, 命令, 请求`, `Id rop caps`. insist,  demand, request, require, recommend, order, prefer, propose, command, advise, suggest, 及其他们的**名词形式**引导的**同位语从句**.

**特别注意:**

suggest 有**表明,暗示**的意思. insist 有**坚持认为**的意思. 注意分辨是否使用虚拟.



2. It is **重要/必要** that + (should) + do

包括: necessary,  essential, important, vital, significant, natural.

3. It is strange/surprising/impossible/a pity/no wonder that + should + do, 竟然...

```
it's strange that he (should) leave without a word.
```



# 综合

1. if only + 句子, 要是...就好了

不需要主句.

```
if only I were a bird!
```

2. as if/though + 句子, 就好像.

```
He looks as if he were dead.
```

3. Wish + 句子, 多希望; `I hope` 是真实希望(可能发生的).

```
I wish we had a big house now.
```

以上3种, **虚拟句子时态比主句时态退一步**. 需要注意, 虚拟语气没有`was`, 用`were`.

4. would rather + 句子, 宁愿...

时态: `现在 ==> did, 过去 ==> had done, 将来 ==> did`.

```
I'd rather you were at home now.
```

5. It is (about/high) time + 句子, 早该到...时间了; `it's time to do`表现在是...的时间.

句子时态`只能`加`一般过去时`.

```
It's time you went to bed
```
