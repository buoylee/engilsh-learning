# A Magical Journey of Words

Once upon a time, a curious traveler set out on an adventure to **impress(给人深刻印象)** the villagers and **impress(盖章)** documents that proved his identity. He hoped to **engender(引起)** trust among strangers and **engender(产生)** new friendships. His friends told him that, **in all probability(很可能)**, he would succeed, but also warned him that **in all probability(大概)** storms would slow him down.

He had been **wedded(结婚)** to his dreams since childhood and felt **wedded(紧密结合)** to the idea of freedom. To start the journey, he needed to **lay(放置)** plans on the table and sometimes **lay(下蛋)** for food. After many nights, he had **lain(躺着)** under the stars, thinking of paths where dangers had **lain(潜伏)** unseen. With great **certainty(确定性)**, he walked on, but he knew that nothing was ever a **certainty(必然的事情)** in this world.

Carrying a **bond(纽带)** of friendship bracelets and repaying a financial **bond(债券)**, he followed the **regularity(规律性)** of sunrise and fought against the **regularity(刻板性)** of city life. His plan would **apply to(适用于)** farmers who till the land and **apply to(申请)** scholars seeking knowledge. Along the way, he found a **fault(错误)** in the map and noticed a **fault(断层)** in the mountains.

Villagers crafted tools from **plastic(塑料)** and showed a **plastic(可塑的)** mindset when solving problems. He met **scores of(许多)** wanderers and conquered **scores of(大量)** challenges. A **landlocked(内陆的)** town offered no sea view, while a **landlocked(封闭的)** valley trapped fresh air. Nature set a **barrier(障碍)** of vines and a **barrier(分界线)** of rivers between him and the treasure.

He had to **determine(决定)** his fate and **determine(测定)** the water’s depth. With an **objective(目标)** in mind and an **objective(客观的)** observation of dangers, he crossed frozen **permafrost(永久冻土)** plains where **permafrost(冰封的土地)** cracked under his boots. Some items were put **aside(放在一边)** for safety, and **aside(旁白地)** he muttered his fears. Others warned him that **aside from(除了)** hunger and **aside from(撇开)** fear, nothing could stop him.

He learned to **imply(暗示)** his needs and **imply(意味着)** hidden risks. He had to **maintain(维持)** bridges and **maintain(坚持说)** his innocence when blamed. Even in hardships, he could **enjoy(享受)** the sunshine and **enjoy(拥有)** secret advantages. With the **onrush(猛冲)** of rivers and the **onrush(蜂拥而至)** of travelers, he had to **bear(承受)** pain and **bear(生育)** responsibility for others. Each **episode(片段)** of his journey became an **episode(插曲)** in campfire tales.

He crossed a **boundary(边界)** of nations and learned the **boundary(限度)** of human patience. Climbing hills helped him **get an idea of(了解)** the terrain and **get an idea of(想象)** future dangers. He found an **appealing(吸引人的)** oasis yet faced an **appealing(上诉)** to ancient law. Some merchants would **associate with(与...来往)** heroes, while elders **associate with(联想)** lost legends. He had to **leave(离开)** his home and **leave(留下)** memories with each friend. Through hardships, he prayed for **mercy(仁慈)** from gods and begged for **mercy(宽恕)** after mistakes.

Traveling **off and on(断断续续)** across deserts and rainforests, he guided an **operation(行动)** to rescue villagers and repaired an **operation(手术)** wound from a wild beast. To survive, he had to **secure(确保)** food supplies and **secure(获得)** rare artifacts. He gained a **competitive edge(竞争优势)** in trade and polished a knife’s **competitive edge(刀刃)** sharp. Even when **circumstantial(偶然的)** luck struck, only **circumstantial(依情况而定的)** evidence helped him escape trials.

His **foresight(先见之明)** saved lives, while **foresight(眼力)** saw hidden traps. A **grid(电网)** powered villages and a **grid(网格)** marked paths on maps. He entered a **complex(复杂的)** cave and explored a vast **complex(综合体)** of ancient buildings. Legends would **bring forth(产生)** courage and **bring forth(提出)** challenges to test him. He learned to **encapsulate(概括)** wisdom and **encapsulate(封装)** herbs in potions. To win, he had to **push out(推出)** new ideas and **push out(排挤)** greedy rivals. After storms, waves would **wash up(冲上岸)** relics, and they would **wash up(洗干净)** camp tools.

On rivers, **buoyant(漂浮的)** boats danced, and traders stayed **buoyant(乐观的)** despite danger. Golden fields of **dandelion(蒲公英)** swayed, and children used **dandelion(蒲公英的)** roots for medicine. Villages would **multiply(成倍增加)** in population and **multiply(相乘)** harvest yields. Many wished to **settle down(定居)** in peace or **settle down(安定下来)** after storms. Books gave **instruction(指导)** to build shelters and **instruction(命令)** to guard secrets. Climbers sought a **toehold(立足点)** on cliffs and a **toehold(初步优势)** in negotiations.
